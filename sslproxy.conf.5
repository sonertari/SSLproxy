.SH "NAME"
.LP 
\fBsslproxy.conf\fR \- Configuration file for SSLproxy
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
The file sslproxy.conf configures SSLproxy, sslproxy(1).
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
The file consists of comments and options with arguments. Each line which 
starts with a hash (\fB#\fR) symbol is ignored by the parser. Options and 
arguments are of the form \fBOption Argument\fR. The arguments are of the 
following types:
.TP
\fBBOOL\fR 
Boolean value (yes/no).
.TP 
\fBSTRING\fR
String.
.TP 
\fBNUMBER\fR
Unsigned integer.
.SH "DIRECTIVES"
.LP 
When an option is not used (hashed or doesn't exist in the configuration file) 
sslproxy takes a default action. If an option does not have a command line 
equivalent, -o opt=val option can be used to override it on the command line.
.TP 
\fBCACert STRING\fR

.TP
\fBCAKey STRING\fR
Use CA key (and cert) to sign forged certs. Equivalent to -k command line option.
.TP 
\fBClientCert STRING\fR
Use cert from pemfile when destination requests client certs. Equivalent to -a command line option.
.TP
\fBClientKey STRING\fR

Use CA chain from pemfile (intermediate and root CA certs). Equivalent to -C command line option.
.TP
\fBLeafCerts STRING\fR
Use key from pemfile for leaf certs. Equivalent to -K command line option.
.br
Default: generate
.TP
\fBCRL STRING\fR
Use URL as CRL distribution point for all forged certs. Equivalent to -q command line option.
.TP
\fBTargetCertDir STRING\fR
Use cert+chain+key PEM files from certdir to target all sites matching the common names (non-matching: generate if CA). Equivalent to -t command line option.
.TP
\fBWriteGenCertsDir STRING\fR
Write leaf key and only generated certificates to gendir. Equivalent to -w command line option.
.TP
\fBWriteAllCertsDir STRING\fR

auth or no matching cert and no CA. Equivalent to -P command line option.
.br 
Default: drop
.TP
\fBPassSite STRING\fR
Passthrough site: site [(clientaddr|(user|*) [description keyword])]. If the 
site matches SNI or common names in the SSL certificate, the connection is 
passed through the proxy. Per site filters can be defined using client IP 
addresses, users, and description keywords. '*' matches all users. User auth 
should be enabled for user and description keyword filtering to work. 
Case is ignored while matching description keywords. Multiple sites are 
allowed, one on each line.
