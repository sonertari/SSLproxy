## Overview

SSLproxy is a proxy for SSL/TLS encrypted network connections.  It is intended 
to be used for decrypting and diverting network traffic to other programs, such 
as UTM services, for deep SSL inspection. See [this 
presentation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12YaGIGs0-xfpqMNAY3rzUbIyed-Tso8W) 
for a summary.

SSLproxy is designed to transparently terminate connections that are redirected
to it using a network address translation engine.  SSLproxy then terminates
SSL/TLS and initiates a new SSL/TLS connection to the original destination
address. Packets received on the client side are decrypted and sent to the
program listening on a port given in the proxy specification. SSLproxy inserts
in the first packet the address and port it is expecting to receive the packets
back from the program. Upon receiving the packets back, SSLproxy re-encrypts
and sends them to their original destination. The return traffic follows the
same path back to the client in reverse order.

This is similar in principle to [divert 
sockets](https://man.openbsd.org/divert.4), where the packet filter diverts the 
packets to a program listening on a divert socket, and after processing the 
packets the program reinjects them into the kernel. If there is no program 
listening on that divert socket or the program does not reinject the packets 
into the kernel, the connection is effectively blocked. In the case of 
SSLproxy, SSLproxy acts as both the packet filter and the kernel, and the 
communication occurs over networking sockets.

For example, given the following proxy specification:

	https 127.0.0.1 8443 up:8080

The SSLproxy listens for HTTPS connections on 127.0.0.1:8443. Upon receiving a 
connection from the Client, it decrypts and diverts the packets to a Program 
listening on 127.0.0.1:8080. After processing the packets, the Program gives 
them back to the SSLproxy listening on a dynamically assigned address, which 
the Program obtains from the first packet in the connection. Then the SSLproxy 
re-encrypts and sends the packets to the Server. The response from the Server 
follows the same path to the Client in reverse order.

The program that packets are diverted to should support this mode of operation.
Specifically, it should be able to recognize the SSLproxy address in the first
packet, and give the first and subsequent packets back to the SSLproxy 
listening on that address, instead of sending them to the original destination 
as it normally would.

A sample line SSLproxy inserts into the first packet in the connection is the 
following:

	SSLproxy: [127.0.0.1]:34649,[192.168.3.24]:47286,[192.168.111.130]:443,s

The first IP:port pair is a dynamically assigned address that the SSLproxy 
expects the program send the packets back to it. The second and third IP:port 
pairs are the actual source and destination addresses of the connection 
respectively. Since the program receives the packets from the SSLproxy, it 
cannot determine the source and destination addresses of the packets by 
itself, hence must rely on the information in this SSLproxy line. The last 
letter is either s or p, for SSL/TLS encrypted or plain traffic respectively. 
This information is also important for the program, because it cannot reliably 
determine if the actual network traffic it is processing was encrypted or not.

This mode of operation allows you to divert decrypted packets to remote 
listening programs too. For example, given the following proxy specification:

	https 127.0.0.1 8443 up:8080 ua:192.168.0.1 ra:192.168.1.1

The ua option tells SSLproxy to divert decrypted packets to 192.168.0.1:8080, 
instead of 127.0.0.1:8080 as in the previous example. Also, the ra option 
tells SSLproxy to listen for returned packets from the program on 192.168.1.1. 
Accordingly, the line SSLproxy inserts into the first packet in the connection 
now becomes:

	SSLproxy: [192.168.1.1]:34649,[192.168.3.24]:47286,[192.168.111.130]:443,s

So, the listening program can be running on a machine anywhere in the world. 
Since the packets between SSLproxy and the listening program are unencrypted, 
you should be careful while using such a setup.

SSLproxy supports plain TCP, plain SSL, HTTP, HTTPS, POP3, POP3S, SMTP, and 
SMTPS connections over both IPv4 and IPv6.  It also has the ability to 
dynamically upgrade plain TCP to SSL in order to generically support SMTP 
STARTTLS and similar upgrade mechanisms.  SSLproxy fully supports Server Name 
Indication (SNI) and is able to work with RSA, DSA and ECDSA keys and DHE and 
ECDHE cipher suites.  Depending on the version of OpenSSL, SSLproxy supports 
SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2, and optionally SSL 2.0 as well.

For SSL and HTTPS connections, SSLproxy generates and signs forged X509v3
certificates on-the-fly, mimicking the original server certificate's subject
DN, subjectAltName extension and other characteristics.  SSLproxy has the
ability to use existing certificates of which the private key is available,
instead of generating forged ones.  SSLproxy supports NULL-prefix CN
certificates but otherwise does not implement exploits against specific
certificate verification vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS stacks.

SSLproxy implements a number of defences against mechanisms which would
normally prevent MitM attacks or make them more difficult.  SSLproxy can deny
OCSP requests in a generic way.  For HTTP and HTTPS connections, SSLproxy
mangles headers to prevent server-instructed public key pinning (HPKP), avoid
strict transport security restrictions (HSTS), avoid Certificate Transparency
enforcement (Expect-CT) and prevent switching to QUIC/SPDY, HTTP/2 or
WebSockets (Upgrade, Alternate Protocols).  HTTP compression, encodings and
keep-alive are disabled to make the logs more readable.

Another reason to disable persistent connections is to reduce file descriptor 
usage. Accordingly, connections are closed if they remain idle for a certain 
period of time. The default timeout is 120 seconds, which can be changed in a 
configuration file.

SSLproxy verifies upstream certificates by default. If the verification fails,
the connection is terminated immediately. This is in contrast to SSLsplit,
because in order to maximize the chances that a connection can be successfully
split, SSLsplit accepts all certificates by default, including self-signed
ones. See [The Risks of SSL Inspection](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/cert/2015/03/the-risks-of-ssl-inspection.html)
for the reasons of this difference.

If enabled, the UserAuth option requires network users to log in to the system 
to use SSLproxy (this feature is currently available on OpenBSD and Linux 
only). When users are logged in, they should be recorded on the users table in 
an SQLite3 database. SSLproxy does not create this users table by itself, so 
it should already exist in the SQLite3 database file configured by the 
UserDBPath option. The users table should be created using the following SQL 
statement:

	CREATE TABLE USERS(
	   IP             CHAR(45)     PRIMARY KEY     NOT NULL,
	   USER           CHAR(31)     NOT NULL,
	   ETHER          CHAR(17)     NOT NULL,
	   ATIME          INT          NOT NULL,
	   DESC           CHAR(50)
	);

When SSLproxy accepts a connection, it obtains the ethernet address of the
client IP address from the arp cache of the system, then compares it with
the value in the users table. If the ethernet addresses do not match, the 
connection is redirected to the login page. SSLproxy also compares the atime 
value in the users table with the current system time. If the difference is 
larger than the configured value of the user timeout option, then the 
connection is redirected to the login page. The atime of the IP address in the 
users table is updated with the system time while the connection is being 
terminated. Since this atime update is run using a privsep command, it is 
expensive. So, to reduce the frequency of such updates, it is deferred until 
the user idle time is more than half of the timeout period.

If the UserAuth option is enabled, the user owner of the connection is 
appended at the end of the SSLproxy line, so that the listening program can 
parse and use this information in its logic and/or logging:

	SSLproxy: [127.0.0.1]:34649,[192.168.3.24]:47286,[192.168.111.130]:443,s,soner

If enabled, the ValidateProto option validates protocols in proxy 
specifications. If a connection cannot pass protocol validation, then it is 
terminated. This feature currently supports HTTP, POP3, and SMTP protocols.

PassSite option allows certain SSL sites to be excluded from SSL inspection. 
If a PassSite matches SNI or common names in the SSL certificate, the 
connection is passed through the proxy without being diverted to the listening 
program. For example, sites requiring client authentication can be added as 
PassSite. Per site filters can be defined using client IP addresses, users, 
and description keywords. Multiple sites can be defined, one on each line.

Logging options include traditional SSLproxy connect and content log files as
well as PCAP files and mirroring decrypted traffic to a network interface.
Additionally, certificates, master secrets and local process information can be
logged.

As SSLproxy is based on SSLsplit, this is a modified SSLsplit README file.
See the manual page sslproxy(1) for details on using SSLproxy and setting up
the various NAT engines.


## Requirements

SSLproxy depends on the OpenSSL, libevent 2.x, libpcap and libnet 1.1.x
libraries by default; libpcap and libnet are not needed if the mirroring
feature is omitted.  The build depends on GNU make and a POSIX.2 environment in
`PATH`.  If available, pkg-config is used to locate and configure the
dependencies.  The optional unit tests depend on the check library.

SSLproxy currently supports the following operating systems and NAT mechanisms:

-   FreeBSD: pf rdr and divert-to, ipfw fwd, ipfilter rdr
-   OpenBSD: pf rdr-to and divert-to
-   Linux: netfilter REDIRECT and TPROXY
-   Mac OS X: pf rdr and ipfw fwd

Support for local process information (`-i`) is currently available on Mac OS X
and FreeBSD.

SSL/TLS features and compatibility greatly depend on the version of OpenSSL
linked against.  For optimal results, use a recent release of OpenSSL or
LibreSSL.


## Installation

With the requirements above available, run:

    make
    make test       # optional unit tests
    make sudotest   # optional unit tests requiring privileges
    make install    # optional install

Dependencies are autoconfigured using pkg-config.  If dependencies are not
picked up and fixing `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` does not help, you can specify their
respective locations manually by setting `OPENSSL_BASE`, `LIBEVENT_BASE`,
`LIBPCAP_BASE`, `LIBNET_BASE` and/or `CHECK_BASE` to the respective prefixes.

You can override the default install prefix (`/usr/local`) by setting `PREFIX`.
