.SH DESCRIPTION
SSLproxy is a proxy for SSL/TLS encrypted network connections.  It is intended 
to be used for decrypting and diverting network traffic to other programs, such 
as UTM services.
.LP
SSLproxy is designed to transparently terminate connections that are redirected 
to it using a network address translation engine.  SSLproxy then terminates 
SSL/TLS and initiates a new SSL/TLS connection to the original destination 
address. Packets received on the client side are decrypted and sent to a 
program listening on the port given in the proxy specification. SSLproxy 
inserts in the first packet the address and port it is expecting to receive the 
packets back from the program. Upon receiving the packets back, SSLproxy 
re-encrypts and sends them to their original destination. The return traffic 
follows the same path back to the client in reverse order.
.LP
This is similar in principle to divert sockets, divert(4), where the packet 
filter diverts the packets to a program listening on a divert socket, and after 
processing the packets the program reinjects them into the kernel. If there is 
no program listening on that divert socket or the program does not reinject the 
packets into the kernel, the connection is effectively blocked. In the case of 
SSLproxy, SSLproxy acts as both the packet filter and the kernel, and the 
communication occurs over networking sockets.
.LP
The program that packets are diverted to should support this mode of operation. 
Specifically, it should be able to recognize the SSLproxy address in the first 
packet, and give the first and subsequent packets back to SSLproxy listening on 
that address, instead of sending them to the original destination as it 
normally would. For an example, see the lp program under the extra folder in 
the sources.
.LP
SSLproxy supports plain TCP, plain SSL, HTTP, HTTPS, POP3, POP3S, SMTP, and 
SMTPS connections over both IPv4 and IPv6.  It also has the ability to 
dynamically upgrade plain TCP to SSL in order to generically support SMTP 
STARTTLS and similar upgrade mechanisms.  SSLproxy fully supports Server Name 
Indication (SNI) and is able to work with RSA, DSA and ECDSA keys and DHE and 
ECDHE cipher suites.  Depending on the version of OpenSSL, SSLproxy supports 
SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2, and optionally SSL 2.0 as well.
.LP
For SSL/TLS connections, SSLproxy generates and signs forged X509v3 
certificates on-the-fly, mimicking the original server certificate's subject 
DN, subjectAltName extension and other characteristics.  SSLproxy has the 
ability to use existing certificates of which the private key is available, 
instead of generating forged ones.  SSLproxy supports NULL-prefix CN 
certificates but otherwise does not implement exploits against specific 
certificate verification vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS stacks.
.LP
SSLproxy implements a number of defences against mechanisms which would 
normally prevent MitM attacks or make them more difficult.  SSLproxy can deny 
OCSP requests in a generic way.
For HTTP and HTTPS connections, SSLproxy mangles headers to
prevent server-instructed public key pinning (HPKP),
avoid strict transport security restrictions (HSTS),
avoid Certificate Transparency enforcement (Expect-CT) and
prevent switching to QUIC/SPDY, HTTP/2 or WebSockets (Upgrade,
Alternate Protocols).
HTTP compression, encodings and keep-alive are disabled to make the logs more
readable.
.LP
Another reason to disable persistent connections is to reduce file descriptor 
usage. Accordingly, connections are closed if they remain idle for a certain 
period of time. The default timeout is 120 seconds, which can be changed in 
configuration file.
.LP
SSLproxy verifies upstream certificates by default. If the verification fails, 
the connection is terminated immediately. This is in contrast to SSLsplit, 
because in order to maximize the chances that a connection can be successfully 
split, SSLsplit accepts all certificates by default, including self-signed 
ones.
.LP
If enabled, the UserAuth option requires network users to log in to the system 
to use SSLproxy (this feature is currently available on OpenBSD and Linux 
only). When users are logged in, they should be recorded on the users table in 
an SQLite3 database. SSLproxy does not create this users table by itself, so 
it should already exist in the SQLite3 database file configured by the 
UserDBPath option. The users table should be created using the following SQL 
statement:
.LP
CREATE TABLE USERS(
   IP             CHAR(45)     PRIMARY KEY     NOT NULL,
   USER           CHAR(31)     NOT NULL,
   ETHER          CHAR(17)     NOT NULL,
   ATIME          INT          NOT NULL,
   DESC           CHAR(50)
);
.LP
When SSLproxy accepts a connection, it obtains the ethernet address of the
client IP address from the arp cache of the system, then compares it with
the value in the users table. If the ethernet addresses do not match, the 
connection is redirected to the login page. SSLproxy also compares the atime 
value in the users table with the current system time. If the difference is 
larger than the configured value of the user timeout option, then the 
connection is redirected to the login page. The atime of the IP address in the 
users table is updated with the system time while the connection is being 
terminated. Since this atime update is run using a privsep command, it is 
expensive. So, to reduce the frequency of such updates, it is deferred until 
the user idle time is more than half of the timeout period.
.LP
If enabled, the ValidateProto option validates protocols in proxy 
specifications. If a connection cannot pass protocol validation, then it is 
terminated. This feature currently supports HTTP, POP3, and SMTP protocols.
.LP
PassSite option allows certain SSL sites to be excluded from SSL inspection. 
If a PassSite matches SNI or common names in the SSL certificate, the 
connection is passed through the proxy without being diverted to the listening 
program. For example, sites requiring client authentication can be added as 
PassSite. Per site filters can be defined using client IP addresses, users, 
and description keywords. Multiple sites can be defined, one on each line.
.LP
Logging options include traditional SSLproxy connect and content log files as
well as PCAP files and mirroring decrypted traffic to a network interface.
Additionally, certificates, master secrets and local process information can be
logged.
.LP
SSLproxy does not automagically redirect any network traffic.  To actually
implement a proxy, you also need to redirect the traffic to the system
running \fBsslproxy\fP.  Your options include running \fBsslproxy\fP on a
legitimate router, ARP spoofing, ND spoofing, DNS poisoning, deploying a rogue
access point (e.g. using hostap mode), physical recabling, malicious VLAN
reconfiguration or route injection, /etc/hosts modification and so on.
.LP
As SSLproxy is based on SSLsplit, this is a modified SSLsplit man page.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a \fIpemfile\fP
Use client certificate from \fIpemfile\fP when destination server requests a
client certificate.
.TP
.B \-b \fIpemfile\fP
Use client private key from \fIpemfile\fP when destination server requests a
client certificate.
.TP
.B \-c \fIpemfile\fP
Use CA certificate from \fIpemfile\fP to sign certificates forged on-the-fly.
If \fIpemfile\fP also contains the matching CA private key, it is also loaded,
otherwise it must be provided with \fB-k\fP.
If \fIpemfile\fP also contains Diffie-Hellman group parameters, they are also
loaded, otherwise they can be provided with \fB-g\fP.
If \fB-t\fP is also given, SSLproxy will only forge a certificate if there is
no matching certificate in the provided certificate directory.
.TP
.B \-C \fIpemfile\fP
Use CA certificates from \fIpemfile\fP as extra certificates in the certificate
chain.  This is needed if the CA given with \fB-k\fP and \fB-c\fP is a sub-CA,
in which case any intermediate CA certificates and the root CA certificate must
be included in the certificate chain.
.TP
.B \-d
Detach from TTY and run as a daemon, logging error messages to syslog instead
of standard error.
.TP
.B \-D \fIlevel\fP
Run in debug mode, log lots of debugging information to standard error.  This
also forces foreground mode and cannot be used with \fB-d\fP. Debug \fIlevel\fP 
can be a number from 1 to 4, a higher number meaning more verbosity.

.TP
.B \-e \fIengine\fP
Use \fIengine\fP as the default NAT engine for \fIproxyspecs\fP without
explicit NAT engine, static destination address or SNI mode.
\fIengine\fP can be any of the NAT engines supported by the system, as
returned by \fB-E\fP.
.TP
.B \-E
List all supported NAT engines available on the system and exit.  See
NAT ENGINES for a list of NAT engines currently supported by SSLproxy.
.TP
.B \-f \fIconffile\fP
Read configuration from \fIconffile\fP.
.TP
.B \-F \fIlogspec\fP
Log connection content to separate log files with the given path specification
(see LOG SPECIFICATIONS below).  For each connection, a log file will be
written, which will contain both directions of data as transmitted.
Information about the connection will be contained in the filename only.
Only one of \fB-F\fP, \fB-L\fP and \fB-S\fP may be used (last one wins).
.TP
.B \-g \fIpemfile\fP
Use Diffie-Hellman group parameters from \fIpemfile\fP for Ephemereal
Diffie-Hellman (EDH/DHE) cipher suites.  If \fB-g\fP is not given, SSLproxy
first tries to load DH parameters from the PEM files given by \fB-K\fP,
\fB-k\fP or \fB-c\fP.  If no DH parameters are found in the key files, built-in
group parameters are automatically used.
The \fB-g\fP option is only available if SSLproxy was built against a version
of OpenSSL which supports Diffie-Hellman cipher suites.
.TP
.B \-G \fIcurve\fP
Use the named \fIcurve\fP for Ephemereal Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE)
cipher suites.  If \fB-G\fP is not given, a default curve (\fBprime256v1\fP) is
used automatically.
The \fB-G\fP option is only available if SSLproxy was built against a version
of OpenSSL which supports Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman cipher suites.
.TP
.B \-h
Display help on usage and exit.
.TP
.B \-i
For each connection, find the local process owning the connection.  This makes
process information such as pid, owner:group and executable path for
connections originating on the same system as SSLproxy available to the
connect log and enables the respective \fB-F\fP path specification directives.
\fB-i\fP is available on Mac OS X and FreeBSD; support for other platforms has
not been implemented yet.
.TP
.B \-I \fIif\fP
Mirror connection content as emulated packets to interface \fIif\fP with
destination address given by \fB-T\fP.  This option is not available if
SSLproxy was built without mirroring support.
.TP
.B \-j \fIjaildir\fP
Change the root directory to \fIjaildir\fP using chroot(2) after opening files.
Note that this has implications for \fBsni\fP \fIproxyspecs\fP.
Depending on your operating system, you will need to copy files such as
\fB/etc/resolv.conf\fP to \fIjaildir\fP in order for name resolution to work.
Using \fBsni\fP proxyspecs depends on name resolution.
Some operating systems require special device nodes such as \fB/dev/null\fP
to be present within the jail.  Check your system's documentation for details.
.TP
.B \-J
Enable connection statistics logging.
.TP
.B \-k \fIpemfile\fP
Use CA private key from \fIpemfile\fP to sign certificates forged on-the-fly.
If \fIpemfile\fP also contains the matching CA certificate, it is also loaded,
otherwise it must be provided with \fB-c\fP.
If \fIpemfile\fP also contains Diffie-Hellman group parameters, they are also
loaded, otherwise they can be provided with \fB-g\fP.
If \fB-t\fP is also given, SSLproxy will only forge a certificate if there is
no matching certificate in the provided certificate directory.
.TP
.B \-K \fIpemfile\fP
Use private key from \fIpemfile\fP for the leaf certificates forged on-the-fly.
If \fB-K\fP is not given, SSLproxy will generate a random 2048-bit RSA key.
.TP
.B \-l \fIlogfile\fP
Log connections to \fIlogfile\fP in a single line per connection format,
including addresses and ports and some HTTP and SSL information, if available.
SIGHUP or SIGUSR1 will cause \fIlogfile\fP to be re-opened.
.TP
.B \-L \fIlogfile\fP
Log connection content to \fIlogfile\fP.  The content log will contain a
parsable log format with transmitted data, prepended with headers identifying
the connection and the data length of each logged segment.
SIGHUP or SIGUSR1 will cause \fIlogfile\fP to be re-opened.
Only one of \fB-F\fP, \fB-L\fP and \fB-S\fP may be used (last one wins).
.TP
.B \-m
When dropping privileges using \fB-u\fP, override the target primary group
to be set to \fIgroup\fP.
.TP
.B \-M \fIlogfile\fP
Log master keys to \fIlogfile\fP in SSLKEYLOGFILE format as defined by Mozilla.
Logging master keys in this format allows for decryption of SSL/TLS traffic
using Wireshark.
Note that unlike browsers implementing this feature, setting the SSLKEYLOGFILE
environment variable has no effect on SSLproxy.
SIGHUP or SIGUSR1 will cause \fIlogfile\fP to be re-opened.
.TP
.B \-O
Deny all Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) requests on all
\fIproxyspecs\fP and for all OCSP servers with an OCSP response of
\fBtryLater\fP, causing OCSP clients to temporarily accept even revoked
certificates.
HTTP requests are being treated as OCSP requests if the method is \fBGET\fP
and the URI contains a syntactically valid OCSPRequest ASN.1 structure
parsable by OpenSSL, or if the method is \fBPOST\fP and the \fBContent-Type\fP
is \fBapplication/ocsp-request\fP.
For this to be effective, SSLproxy must be handling traffic destined to the
port used by the OCSP server.  In particular, SSLproxy must be configured to
receive traffic to all ports used by OCSP servers of targeted certificates
within the \fIcertdir\fP specified by \fB-t\fP.
.TP
.B \-p \fIpidfile\fP
Write the process ID to \fIpidfile\fP and refuse to run if the \fIpidfile\fP
is already in use by another process.
.TP
.B \-P
Passthrough SSL/TLS connections which cannot be split instead of dropping them.
Connections cannot be split if \fB-c\fP and \fB-k\fP are not given and the
site does not match any certificate loaded using \fB-t\fP, or if the connection
to the original server gives SSL/TLS errors.  Specifically, this happens if the
site requests a client certificate.
In these situations, passthrough with \fB-P\fP results in uninterrupted service
for the clients, while dropping is the more secure alternative if unmonitored
connections must be prevented.
Passthrough mode currently does not apply to SSL/TLS errors in the connection
from the client, since the connection from the client cannot easily be retried.
Specifically, \fB-P\fP does not currently work for clients that do not accept
forged certificates.
.TP
.B \-q \fIcrlurl\fP
Set CRL distribution point (CDP) \fIcrlurl\fP on forged leaf certificates.
Some clients, such as some .NET applications, reject certificates that do not
carry a CDP.  When using \fB-q\fP, you will need to generate an empty CRL
signed by the CA certificate and key provided with \fB-c\fP and \fB-k\fP, and
make it available at \fIcrlurl\fP.
.TP
.B \-r \fIproto\fP
Force SSL/TLS protocol version on both client and server side to \fIproto\fP
by selecting the respective OpenSSL method constructor instead of the default
SSLv23_method() which supports all protocol versions.
This is useful when analyzing traffic to a server that only supports a specific
version of SSL/TLS and does not implement proper protocol negotiation.
Depending on build options and the version of OpenSSL that is used, the
following values for \fIproto\fP are accepted: \fBssl2\fP, \fBssl3\fP,
\fBtls10\fP, \fBtls11\fP and \fBtls12\fP.
Note that SSL 2.0 support is not built in by default because some servers
don't handle SSL 2.0 Client Hello messages gracefully.
.TP
.B \-R \fIproto\fP
Disable the SSL/TLS protocol version \fIproto\fP on both client and server
side by disabling the respective protocols in OpenSSL.  To disable multiple
protocol versions, \fB-R\fP can be given multiple times.  If \fI-r\fP is also
given, there will be no effect in disabling other protocol versions.
Disabling protocol versions is useful when analyzing traffic to a server that
does not handle some protocol versions well, or to test behaviour with
different protocol versions.
Depending on build options and the version of OpenSSL that is used, the
following values for \fIproto\fP are accepted: \fBssl2\fP, \fBssl3\fP,
\fBtls10\fP, \fBtls11\fP and \fBtls12\fP.
Note that SSL 2.0 support is not built in by default because some servers
don't handle SSL 2.0 Client Hello messages gracefully.
.TP
.B \-s \fIciphers\fP
Use OpenSSL \fIciphers\fP specification for both server and client SSL/TLS
connections.  If \fB-s\fP is not given, a cipher list of \fBALL:-aNULL\fP is
used.
Normally, SSL/TLS implementations choose the most secure cipher suites, not the
fastest ones.  By specifying an appropriate OpenSSL cipher list, the set of
cipher suites can be limited to fast algorithms, or \fBeNULL\fP cipher suites
can be added.  Note that for connections to be successful, the SSLproxy cipher
suites must include at least one cipher suite supported by both the client and
the server of each connection.
See ciphers(1) for details on how to construct OpenSSL cipher lists.
.TP
.B \-S \fIlogdir\fP
Log connection content to separate log files under \fIlogdir\fP.  For each
connection, a log file will be written, which will contain both directions of
data as transmitted.  Information about the connection will be contained in
the filename only.
Only one of \fB-F\fP, \fB-L\fP and \fB-S\fP may be used (last one wins).
.TP
.B \-t \fIcertdir\fP
Use private key, certificate and certificate chain from PEM files in
\fIcertdir\fP for connections to hostnames matching the respective
certificates, instead of using certificates forged on-the-fly.
A single PEM file must contain a single private key, a single certificate and
optionally intermediate and root CA certificates to use as certificate chain.
When using \fB-t\fP, SSLproxy will first attempt to use a matching certificate
loaded from \fIcertdir\fP.
If \fB-c\fP and \fB-k\fP are also given, certificates will be forged
on-the-fly for sites matching none of the common names in the certificates
loaded from \fIcertdir\fP.
Otherwise, connections matching no certificate will be dropped, or if
\fB-P\fP is given, passed through without splitting SSL/TLS.
.TP
.B \-T \fIaddr\fP
Mirror connection content as emulated packets to destination address \fIaddr\fP
on the interface given by \fB-I\fP.  Only IPv4 target addresses are currently
supported.  This option is not available if SSLproxy was built without
mirroring support.
.TP
.B \-u \fIuser\fP
Drop privileges after opening sockets and files by setting the real,
effective and stored user IDs to \fIuser\fP and loading the appropriate
primary and ancillary groups.  If \fB-u\fP is not given, SSLproxy will drop
privileges to the stored UID if EUID != UID (setuid bit scenario), or to
\fBnobody\fP if running with full \fBroot\fP privileges (EUID == UID == 0).
User \fIuser\fP needs to be allowed to make outbound TCP connections, and in
some configurations, to also perform DNS resolution.
Dropping privileges enables privilege separation, which incurs latency for
certain options, such as separate per-connection log files.  By using
\fB-u root\fP, SSLproxy can be run as root without dropping privileges.
Due to an Apple bug, \fB-u\fP cannot be used with \fBpf\fP proxyspecs on
Mac OS X.
.TP
.B \-x \fIengine\fP
Use the OpenSSL engine with identifier \fIengine\fP as a default engine.  The
engine must be available within the OpenSSL ecosystem under the specified
identifier, that is, they must be loaded from the global OpenSSL configuration.
If \fIengine\fP is an absolute path, it will be interpreted as path to an
engine dynamically linked library and loaded by path, regardless of global
OpenSSL configuration.
This option is only available if built against a version of OpenSSL with engine
support.
.TP
.B \-X \fIpcapfile\fP
Log connection content to \fIpcapfile\fP in PCAP format, with emulated TCP, IP
and Ethernet headers.
SIGHUP or SIGUSR1 will cause \fIpcapfile\fP to be re-opened.
Only one of \fB-X\fP, \fB-Y\fP and \fB-y\fP may be used (last one wins).
.TP
.B \-Y \fIpcapdir\fP
Log connection content to separate PCAP files under \fIpcapdir\fP.  For each
connection, a separate PCAP file will be written.
Only one of \fB-X\fP, \fB-Y\fP and \fB-y\fP may be used (last one wins).
.TP
.B \-y \fIpcapspec\fP
Log connection content to separate PCAP files with the given path specification
(see LOG SPECIFICATIONS below).  For each connection, a separate PCAP file will
be written.
Only one of \fB-X\fP, \fB-Y\fP and \fB-y\fP may be used (last one wins).
.TP
.B \-V
Display version and compiled features information and exit.
.TP
.B \-w \fIgendir\fP
Write generated keys and certificates to individual files in \fIgendir\fP.
For keys, the key identifier is used as filename, which consists of the SHA-1
hash of the ASN.1 bit string of the public key, as referenced by the
subjectKeyIdentifier extension in certificates.
For certificates, the SHA-1 fingerprints of the original and the used (forged)
certificate are combined to form the filename.
Note that only newly generated certificates are written to disk.
.TP
.B \-W \fIgendir\fP
Same as \fB-w\fP, but also write original certificates and certificates not
newly generated, such as those loaded from \fB-t\fP.
.TP
.B \-Z
Disable SSL/TLS compression on all connections.  This is useful if your
limiting factor is CPU, not network bandwidth.
The \fB-Z\fP option is only available if SSLproxy was built against a version
of OpenSSL which supports disabling compression.
.SH "PROXY SPECIFICATIONS"
SSLproxy supports two types of proxy specifications: one line and structured. 
The structured proxy specifications provide more configuration options, but 
can only be defined in configuration files. See sslproxy.conf(5) and the 
sample configuration file in the sources for details.
.LP
One line proxy specifications (\fIproxyspecs\fP) consist of the connection 
type, listen address and program port. You can also specify program and return 
addresses, otherwise they default to the loopback address 127.0.0.1. The 
program and return address options help you divert packets to remote 
locations. However, beware that the diverted traffic is always unencrypted:

.SH "NAT ENGINES"
SSLproxy currently supports the following NAT engines:
.TP
.B pf
OpenBSD packet filter (pf) \fBrdr\fP/\fBrdr-to\fP NAT redirects, also available
on FreeBSD, NetBSD and Mac OS X.
Fully supported, including IPv6.
Note that SSLproxy needs permission to open \fB/dev/pf\fP for reading, which by

IPFilter (ipfilter, ipf), available on many systems, including FreeBSD, NetBSD,
Linux and Solaris.
Note that SSLproxy needs permission to open \fB/dev/ipnat\fP for reading, which

Note that SSLproxy is only able to accept incoming connections if it binds
to the correct IP address (e.g. 192.0.2.1) or on all interfaces (0.0.0.0).
REDIRECT uses the local interface address of the incoming interface as
target IP address, or 127.0.0.1 for locally generated packets.

.RE
.SH SIGNALS
A running \fBsslproxy\fP accepts SIGINT and SIGTERM for a clean shutdown and
SIGUSR1 to re-open the single-file log files (such as \fB-l\fP, \fB-L\fP and
\fB-X\fP).  The canonical way to rotate or post-process logs is to rename the
active log file, send SIGUSR1 to the PID in the PID file given by \fB-p\fP,
give SSLproxy some time to flush buffers after closing the old file, and then
post-process the renamed log file.
Per-connection log files (such as \fB-S\fP and \fB-F\fP) are not re-opened
because their filename is specific to the connection.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The \fBsslproxy\fP process will exit with 0 on regular shutdown
(SIGINT, SIGTERM), and 128 + signal number on controlled shutdown based on
receiving a different signal such as SIGHUP.  Exit status in the range 1..127
indicates error conditions.
.SH EXAMPLES
With configuration similar to the above NAT engine samples, intercept HTTPS and 
POP3S over IPv4 using forged certificates with CA private key \fBca.key\fP and 
certificate \fBca.crt\fP, logging connections to \fBconnect.log\fP and 
connection data into separate files under \fB/tmp\fP (add \fB-e\fP 
\fInat-engine\fP to select the appropriate engine if multiple engines are 
available on your system) and diverting packets to a program running on address 
127.0.0.1 and port 8080 for HTTPS and to another program running on address 
127.0.0.1 and port 8110 for POP3S:
.LP
.nf
\fBsslproxy -k ca.key -c ca.crt -l connect.log -L /tmp \\
         https 127.0.0.1 8443 up:8080 \\
         pop3s 127.0.0.1 8995 up:8110\fP
.fi
.LP
To generate a CA private key \fBca.key\fP  and certificate \fBca.crt\fP using
OpenSSL:
.LP
.nf
\fBcat >x509v3ca.cnf <<'EOF'\fP
[ req ]
distinguished_name = reqdn

[ reqdn ]

[ v3_ca ]
basicConstraints        = CA:TRUE

authorityKeyIdentifier  = keyid:always,issuer:always
\fBEOF\fP

\fBopenssl req -new -nodes -x509 -sha256 -out ca.crt -key ca.key \\

        -subj '/O=SSLproxy Root CA/CN=SSLproxy Root CA/' \\
        -set_serial 0 -days 3650\fP
.fi
.SH NOTES
SSLproxy is able to handle a relatively high number of listeners and
connections due to a multithreaded, event based architecture based on libevent,
taking advantage of platform specific select() replacements such as kqueue.
The main thread handles the listeners and signaling, while a number of worker
threads equal to twice the number of CPU cores is used for handling the actual
connections in separate event bases, including the CPU-intensive SSL/TLS
handling.
.LP
Care has been taken to choose well-performing data structures for caching
certificates and SSL sessions.  Logging is implemented in separate disk writer
threads to ensure that socket event handling threads don't have to block on
disk I/O.
DNS lookups are performed asynchronously.
SSLproxy uses SSL session caching on both ends to minimize the amount of full
SSL handshakes, but even then, the limiting factor in handling SSL connections
are the actual bignum computations.
.LP
For high performance and low latency and when running SSLproxy as root or
otherwise in a privilege separation mode, avoid using options which require a
privileged operation to be invoked through privilege separation for each
connection.  These are currently all per-connection log types:
content log to per-stream file in dir or filespec (\fB-F\fP, \fB-S\fP),
content log to per-stream PCAP in dir or filespec (\fB-Y\fP, \fB-y\fP), and
generated or all certificates to files in directory (\fB-w\fP, \fB-W\fP).
Instead, use the respective single-file variants where available.
It is possible, albeit not recommended, to bypass the default privilege
separation when run as root by using \fB-u root\fP, thereby bypassing
privilege separation entirely.
